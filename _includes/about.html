                    I am a passionate and skilled game developer with a Bachelor’s degree in Game Development from HKU, specializing in Unity (C#) and immersive technologies such as VR. With a strong foundation in coding principles and game design, I’m particularly interested in AI development and modular code architecture. I am also experienced in Unreal Engine and have hands-on experience with C++, Java, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript, giving me a well-rounded technical skill set.

                    I want to approach the world of game development by designing and building modular architectures for various gameplay systems.
                    One of my personal fascination with game development is the creation of AI. I enjoy the thought process behind creating a behavior tree and how to implement interesting patterns of behavior. Yet I still wonder what other kinds of challenges await me.

                    I am experienced in C#, Unity, C++, Unreal Engine, Arduino, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, WordPress, and have worked on various projects to build applications and games.
                    After a three-year study of application development at the ROC Flevoland, I decided to pursue my passions for video games and fantasy as a game developer.
