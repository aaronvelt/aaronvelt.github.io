                    I am a passionate and skilled game developer with a Bachelor’s degree in Game Development from HKU, specializing in Unity (C#) and immersive technologies such as VR. 
                    With a strong foundation in coding principles and game design, I’m particularly interested in AI development and modular code architecture. 
                    I am also experienced in Unreal Engine and have hands-on experience with C++, Java, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript, giving me a well-rounded technical skill set.

                    I began my journey with a three-year study in Application Development at ROC Flevoland, where I built a solid understanding of software development principles. 
                    I later transitioned into game development to pursue my passion for video games, and I have since applied my skills as a developer on a variety of gaming and software projects. 
                    While game development was the primary focus of my education, I am open to opportunities as an application developer.

                    My time at HKU provided me with valuable insights into the collaborative nature of game development. 
                    Working closely with designers and artists, I gained hands-on experience in their craft, which significantly enhanced our teamwork and project outcomes. 
                    This collaboration not only improved my understanding of design principles but also fostered a strong synergy between technical and artistic elements in our projects.

                    My goal is to contribute to innovative, high-quality experiences by developing robust systems and modular, scalable architectures. 
                    I thrive in collaborative, dynamic environments where I can continue to grow as a programmer and developer.
