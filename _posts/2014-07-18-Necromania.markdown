description: The project I've been working on over the past year is an RTS-inspired roguelike game where you play as a necromancer controlling zombies. Each run is designed to give the player a unique experience while still maintaining the core gameplay.I achieve this through a procedural skill system that generates new skills for the player based on their character and magic discipline.These skills give the player the ability to experiment with new builds and adapt their playstyle.
